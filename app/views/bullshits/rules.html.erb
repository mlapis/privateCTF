<p>This is a private CTF by Maxim. If you werent invited by me, please do not attack it. There is nothing to be found here anyways.</p>
<p>Code can be found here https://github.com/mlapis/privateCTF</p>
<p>Following challenges are currently included:</p>
<p>Access 49.13.158.237:5001/bullshits/1</p>
<p>Access 49.13.158.237:5001/bullshits/basic_auth username: user password: ???</p>
<p>The CTF has a no intended fault lines. I coded very sloppily, but did not include weak points on purpose. I would be glad if you abuse Rails issue, but this was hosted with nginx + dokku and attacking it this way is fair too. Sorry for having a bit messy git history. </p>
<p>I did create it, but I am on your side. If you need any help with anything, understanding Ruby or Rails, ask me. Only thing I wont give you are the passwords.</p>
<p>If you have good ideas for additional challenges, I can gladly add those</p>
<p>Do your worst! </p>
